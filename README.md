# React Toolkit

This project contains unembellished ‘vanilla’ components that can be imported for use on site projects, or to act as starting templates.

Styling is kept purposefully limited, these components are created to get something working. Styling is kept unopinionated.

As is their intended state, the components contained within this project are purposefully not associated with Contensis and once imported for use on a project, will need to be mapped to associate with data in Contensis.

Suitable additions to this library are those that are considered as frequently developed/requested components, to reduce development time spent and establish standardisation.

This project is also intentionally fluid, to maintain the spirit of a dynamic library. All are welcome to contribute to this project, whether this be to modify an existing component or to add new components to the library.
